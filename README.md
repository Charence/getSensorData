# getSensorData
This App is originally designed for Recon jet.

All the images used are from open-resource images, and the background music is from Last.fm, which is composed by Joe Hisaishi, called summer.

This App can be used to track the sensors data, including the accelerometer, the gyroscope and the magnetometer. You can choose to view the data live on the screen or save it.

There is an android phone version as well.
